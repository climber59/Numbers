# Numbers
My attempt to recreate [Numbers Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.zahlenspielpro.lars) by [Lars Fe√üen](https://lars3n95.github.io/).


Click two 'adjacent' numbers that match or add up to the target value. Numbers are 'adjacent' if there is a direct line with only greyed out numbers in between. The rows do wrap around. For example, in the screenshot below, I've selected the '8' at the end of the first row and intend to match it with the '2' in the next row down. Games can end after 10 moves or thousands. When you are out of moves, press 'Check' to add a copy every number still left. 'Condense' will remove blank lines to shrink the board down. As the board gets larger, you can use the mouse wheel to scroll up and down.

The textboxes on the right allow you to change the rules of the game to create more variations.
